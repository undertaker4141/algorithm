# Sorting
## Description

> You are given an array of integers that needs to be sorted in⠀**non-decreasing order**.


Note:
> Avoid **using⠀O(n²) algorithms**, as they may cause⠀**Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)**. Try using⠀**O(n log n) or faster**⠀approaches for better performance.


## Input

> The input consists of two lines:

- The first line contains a single integer⠀**N**(1 ≤ N <20000), the number of elements in the array.

- The second line contains⠀**N**⠀integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of the array.


## Output

Output a single line containing⠀**N**⠀integers in non-decreasing order, separated by spaces.
